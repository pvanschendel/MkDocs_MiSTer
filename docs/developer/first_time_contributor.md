If you want to contribute to the MiSTer project, you have to realize that Sorgelig has the final say on what goes in the project and what not. It would be great if your changes would get merged, so make sure that he agrees with them. Sorge is pretty busy, and likes spending his time creating stuff more than spending it policing and administrating (who doesn't ?). Also consider that he is not a native English speaker, and his replies may unintentionally sound [gruff or angry](https://misterfpga.org/viewtopic.php?t=525). The steps below should help to reduce friction losses for everyone. You can ignore these steps, and your pull request may still be accepted, but there is no reason to expect this.
1. Discuss the issue in the [Mister FPGA Forum](https://misterfpga.org/) or the MiSTer discord channel [mister-debug](https://discord.com/channels/647909397477195803/806759728885006356) Explain the problem and your solution as clearly as possible.
Once your explanation is clear:
2. Create an issue in the git-hub repository of the core you want to change, with the clear description you got in the previous step.
You will usually get a reply within a few days.
3. Should the reply does not agree with you, do not give up! You can ask for clarifcation, or ask others to explain why he does not understand your point (it is probably the other way around). You can fo this in the MiSTer discord channel [dev-talk](https://discord.com/channels/647909397477195803/737505154726756423).
4. Go back to step 2 until you have tried about three times. If things did still not work out, it may be better to give up on the merge, and make a your own fork.
5. Do the changes (all the other pages here are about the nitty gritty details).
   When making changes, consider that this project is not just here for you own enjoyment, so help everyone by following standard best development practices.
6. Create the pull request. If you are not sure how: Github provide some decent [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Changes to the general MiSTer framework and the code running on Linux are especially critical, so following these steps is even more important.
